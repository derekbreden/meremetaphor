<h2 class="chapter-header">PREFACE</h2>
<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>If you believe in a supernatural entity or a creator of the universe, that’s not what this book is about. This book is about an entirely naturalistic (non- supernatural), physicalist, determinist, materialist view of religion and the meaning of the metaphors within it from that (natural) perspective. I understand each reader has their own journey of faith. I’ve seen a spectrum of experience in my own family, from atheism, to conservative Christianity, to progressive Christianity, and many things in between. My intent isn’t to challenge your path, but simply to share and explain a particular one — my own.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-header">ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2>
<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>To give some background about myself: I was raised in a Christian tradition. At age 12, when I was at Bible camp during some free time, I had climbed a tall tree where I could see nothing but nature. At this time, I heard the voice of God speak to me saying that he was “an idea invented by man, changed over thousands of years”. It was easy to identify this voice as being a creation of my own mind, a creation based on what I understood about Christianity and the Christian God, based on what I heard from family and friends and Church leadership. This was a moment of my conscious awareness discovering what my subconscious already deeply believed.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-header">INTRODUCTION: METAPHOR</h2>
<h3>Introduction: Metaphor</h3>
<p>What do I intend the word “metaphor” to mean in this book? When I say “metaphor”, I mean exactly what some people might call “analogy”, and also exactly what some other people might call “maps of meaning”, and what others still might call “abstraction”. There are of course distinctions that can be made between these terms, but I would like you to be able to understand the common theme I am referring to, using whatever term is most familiar to you.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-header">GOD: LOVE WITHIN AND BETWEEN US</h2>
<h3>God: Love Within and Between Us</h3>
<p>The Bible says “God is love”. The Bible describes love as patient and kind, not proud or rude or selfish, keeping no record of wrongs. Love is not a cosmic personality. Love is not a transcendent entity. Love is not supernatural. Love is something natural and real, something we feel and experience, it is a way of being and acting, it is something that regardless of background we can all relate to.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-header">FREE WILL: RECURSING A LIFETIME</h2>
<h3>Free Will: Recursing a Lifetime</h3>
<p>In Conway&#039;s Game of Life, we see patterns emerge from simple rules. It begins with a grid of squares, a few shaded and most others not. It continues with a single step, shading is flipped based on simple rules regarding nearby squares. This exact same step is repeated ad infinitum. Complex structures form, interact, and evolve in ways that are impossible to predict from the starting conditions alone. This emergent complexity is not magic, it is the natural consequence of recursive iteration.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-header">GOOD: A DIRECTION WE CHOOSE</h2>
<h3>Good: A Direction We Choose</h3>
<p>The key point is simple. Words like “good” and “bad” are meaningless without a direction, an orientation, a goal, a target. They only make sense with reference to something. This is precisely the same way that “up” and “down” work. We often use these words, “up” and “down” as well as “good” and “bad”, without explicitly stating that orientation, but there is always an orientation implied. When you say “that&#039;s good”, you are making reference to some target, some goal, some direction that has been chosen.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-header">SIN: ALIGNMENT WITH THAT CHOICE</h2>
<h3>Sin: Alignment With That Choice</h3>
<p>Just like the words “good” and “bad” (and “up” and “down”) only have meaning with an orientation, so too it is with the word “sin”. Sin doesn&#039;t exist independently of the direction and orientation you have chosen. What makes something a “sin” in your view is precisely the direction and orientation you have chosen for yourself. If you have oriented yourself toward kindness, then cruelty becomes a sin. If you have oriented yourself towards de- escalation, then aggression becomes a sin.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-header">REDEMPTION: MAKING NEW CHOICES</h2>
<h3>Redemption: Making New Choices</h3>
<p>Redemption is not about resolving guilt for actions we knew were wrong. It is about seeing our past actions in a new light entirely. It is most often the case that the self that committed what we now see as sin did not view it as sin at the time, and that is the crucial point. When we recursively process our experiences, we can reach new understandings about our past actions. What once seemed justified, necessary, or even good can be recognized as harmful, unnecessary, or misaligned with who we want to be. This recognition creates a discontinuity, and a new self can emerge that sees differently, if we are willing and able to recognize this old self, and willing and able to allow this new self to emerge.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-header">HEAVEN: A STATE OF MIND AND BEING</h2>
<h3>Heaven: A State of Mind and Being</h3>
<p>The threat of Hell and the promise of Heaven, as a destination after life, has been a tool of control and a powerful motivating force. Some have found great comfort from this promise. Some have found great anguish from this threat. This is not the only way to view these things. Heaven is a state of mind, a state of being, available to all of us here and now, through embracing and expressing love for all through our actions in the real world, throughout our short lives. Hell can be easily found as well, in an endless cycle of self-flagellation for a past that cannot be changed, or in worries and consternation over a future that cannot be predicted.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-header">PRAYER: EFFECTS OF SELF-REFLECTION</h2>
<h3>Prayer: Effects of Self-Reflection</h3>
<p>Our thoughts are our own, hidden in some ways, but not permanently. They will eventually manifest in the world. Even if not revealed in the moment through subvocalization, microexpressions, glances, or telling silences, they will eventually be revealed through our future actions, inactions, and words. Silent prayer is a form of deep reflection, a process of clarifying our own thoughts, values, and intentions. We are creating internal states that will inevitably shape our external behaviors.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-header">VOICES: WHAT INSPIRES SHAMANS</h2>
<h3>Voices: What Inspires Shamans</h3>
<p>Throughout human history, many have heard voices. These people have been called prophets, shamans, mystics, and visionaries. In our modern medical framework, they would be diagnosed with schizophrenia or other conditions that feature auditory hallucinations. But regardless of the label, the fundamental experience remains the same. These voices are not supernatural communications from divine entities. They are productions of the human mind, arising from complex neural processes within the brain. Like all artists and their art, these voices reflect and serve as a focal point of society and the world around them.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-header">AFTERWORD</h2>
<h3>Afterword</h3>
<p>My understanding of your words may differ from your understanding of those same words. I hope by sharing some of my understanding here, we might find some common ground. There may not always be a middle ground, but I do believe we all have more in common than we typically realize or discuss.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-header">GLOSSARY</h2>
<h3>Glossary</h3>
<p>Determinism A belief that all that happens in the visible universe obeys physical laws, including the chemical and electrical signals in our brains which in a very real sense are our thoughts and choices. God Love within us and between us. Heaven A place on earth, found through love, experienced in the here and now as a state of mind and being. Love Something we feel, have, see, and share that exists within us and between us — unconditional care for well-being, and a strong desire for deep understanding.</p>
